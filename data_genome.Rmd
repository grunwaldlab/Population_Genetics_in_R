For genomics examples we'll use the pinfsc50 dataset.
The [pinfsc50](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pinfsc50) dataset is from a number of published *P. infestans* genomics projects where the data has been subset here to supercontig_1.50.
This dataset is available as a stand alone R package [@knaus2017vcfr].
By subsetting the data to one supercontig it creates a dataset of a size that can be conveniently used for examples.
This dataset illustrates some important strengths and weaknesses of these studies.
A strength is the amount of data we have for each individual.
Among the weaknesses are that the samples are 'opportunistic' in that we have no control over the design of the experiment.
Also, because of the large investment in data per sample, there is a relatively small number of samples.
